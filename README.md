# Developer Training

Welcome to the DNP Developer Training Repository! This plan is designed to equip new developers with a broad understanding of the software technologies we use in our projects. 

The training program is divided into distinct stages, each located within its own directory. In these directories, you will discover the desired outcomes and valuable links to relevant learning resources. To ensure a smooth learning experience, we recommend following the numbered sequence of directories. However, if you possess a solid understanding of the outcomes covered in a particular directory, feel free to skip ahead.

By diligently following this training plan, you will gain a deep understanding of the core technologies we employ in our software, equipping you to contribute effectively to the DNP's projects and make a meaningful impact. Happy learning!
