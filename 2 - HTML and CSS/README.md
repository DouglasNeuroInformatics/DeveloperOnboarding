# HTML and CSS

## Background

Many people try and learn frameworks such as React without understanding the basics of HTML and CSS, which invariably causes far more pain, frustration, and time wasted than just learning the basics from the start. 

I recommend first going over the beginner material, which shouldn't take more than a few hours. Once you have a general understanding of HTML and CSS, I would get started on creating your own static website. For this, you can just refer to the reference material below. 

## Outcomes
- Build a simple, decent looking static website using pure HTML and CSS
