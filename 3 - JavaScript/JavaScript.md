# JavaScript

## Background

As a programming language, JavaScript is not that complicated. However, it was created in only 10 days back in 1995 and includes a lot of questionable design decisions [questionable design decisions](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs) that can now not be removed without breaking backwards compatibility. Fortunately, modern JavaScript tooling is really good (though a bit of a mess) and you can now use JavaScript for many things beyond frontend web development, including server-side and mobile development. Even more so than with HTML and CSS, many people get excited about doing something cool (e.g., building an app) and then get bogged down in endless tooling configuration and weird quirks (e.g., multiple module bundling systems) that can drain the happiness from even the most jovial person. 

## Outcomes
- Add some interactivity to the website you created in the previous module
